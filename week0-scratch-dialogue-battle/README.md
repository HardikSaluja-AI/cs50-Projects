# Week 0 â€“ Scratch Project: Human vs Robot â€“ Dialogue Theatre Showdown

This Scratch project is part of Harvard's CS50x Week 0.  
It is an interactive and funny game where users watch a dialogue contest between a robot and a human actor, each delivering the same dialogue in different voices.

### ðŸŽ® How to Use:
- Watch the dialogue performance by two sprites.
- Choose who delivered the dialogue better: the human or the robot.
- After three rounds, youâ€™ll see the winner!
- Option to play again and try new dialogues.

### ðŸ’¡ Features:
- Custom voices for robot and human (voice-edited by me).
- Broadcast logic and transitions.
- Loops and a custom block included to meet CS50 requirements.
